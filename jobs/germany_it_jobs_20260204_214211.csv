"Backend Engineer - Agents Team","Taktile","Berlin, BE, DE","fulltime","indeed","2026-02-04","https://de.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=319e208b677b9613","https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/taktile/0d227412-f78f-4812-9200-aebe756a9a65?utm_source=D1jp8XBJ6e","**About the role**
------------------


Taktile is building a platform for creating, publishing, and executing AI\\-powered agents that help teams automate complex workflows in financial services. We're looking for a Backend Engineer to join the Agents team shipping production features that power the agent execution runtime, tool orchestration, and platform infrastructure. If you want to own backend systems end\\-to\\-end, work at the intersection of AI and distributed systems, and see your code in production fast, this role is for you.

**What You'll Do**
------------------

* Build and ship new product features for Taktile’s AI agent platform, from idea to production.
* Own backend work end\\-to\\-end: collaborate on scope, implement, test, release, and iterate based on real usage.
* Help make agent workflows reliable and easy to use by improving how agents run, how they connect to external tools, and how they behave when something goes wrong.
* Work closely with Product and Design, using insights from dogfooding and customer feedback to shape what we build next.
* Raise the quality bar by improving maintainability, clarity, and performance as the platform grows.

**Requirements**
----------------

* Hybrid role based in Berlin. We collaborate in person regularly and don't offer remote\\-only for this position.
* Fluent English required. You'll write design docs, review PRs with context, and occasionally join customer calls.
* Strong engineering fundamentals: you can build clean APIs, debug production issues, optimize database queries, and know when to refactor vs. ship.
* Comfortable operating systems in production and participating in incident response as part of a team rotation.

**Required Experience**
-----------------------

* Production experience with Python: you've shipped APIs using FastAPI, Flask, or Django and understand async patterns, error handling, database transactions, and performance optimization.
* Proficient in REST API design and can create endpoints that scale and maintain over time.
* Prior industry experience with public cloud providers (**preferably AWS**).

**Ideal, But Not Required**
---------------------------

* Experience with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Postgres, Pydantic, or SQLAlchemy.
* Familiarity with LLM application development, agent frameworks, or building platform infrastructure and developer tools.
* Experience with distributed systems, async task processing, observability tooling (tracing, metrics, logging), or previous on\\-call experience.

**Our Offer**
-------------

* Work with colleagues that lift you up, challenge you, celebrate you and help you grow. We come from many different backgrounds, but what we have in common is the desire to operate at the very top of our fields. If you are similarly capable, caring, and driven, you'll find yourself at home here.
* Experience a truly flat hierarchy and communicate directly with founding team members. Having an opinion and voicing your ideas is not only welcome but encouraged, especially when they challenge the status quo.
* Learn from experienced mentors and achieve tremendous personal and professional growth. Get to know and leverage our network of leading tech investors and advisors around the globe.
* Receive a top\\-of\\-market equity and cash compensation package.
* Get access to a self\\-development budget you can use to e.g. attend conferences, buy books or take classes.
* Receive a new Apple MacBook Pro, as well as meaningful home office set\\-up.

**Our Stance**
--------------

* We're eager to meet talented and driven candidates regardless of whether they tick all the boxes. We're looking for someone who will add to our culture, not just fit within it. We strongly encourage individuals from groups traditionally underestimated and underrepresented in tech to apply.
* We seek to actively recognize and combat racism, sexism, ableism and ageism. We embrace and support all gender identities and expressions, and celebrate love in its many forms. We won't inquire about how you identify or if you've experienced discrimination, but if you want to tell your story, we are all ears.

* Systems where usability and correctness directly affect productivity

*Infrastructure as a first\\-class product*  

* Containerized environments and CI/CD pipelines that keep the system moving
* Observability that tells youwhat’shappening before users complain
* Reliability improvements driven by actual failure modes, not hypotheticals

*The full loop: software compute science*  

* Job orchestration and ML system support
* Integration with SLURM\\-based simulation clusters
* Infrastructure decisions informed by real workloads, not abstract benchmarks

#### **Your profile**

* 2–5 years of software engineering experience, with solid Python fundamentals
* Comfort working across the stack. Youdon'tneed to be an expert in everything, butyou'rewilling to dig into unfamiliar territory
* Experience with containerized applications and basic DevOps practices

##### **About us**


**Sunday Natural** emerged from a long\\-standing passion and research in the fields of health, healing, and personal growth. The lack of natural, high\\-quality products on the market was the original motivation for founding Sunday Natural in 2013\\. We aim to produce the products we ourselves would love to buy – as natural as possible, absolutely pure, free from any additives, and of the highest quality. In a strategic partnership with CVC, Sunday Natural is now one of Germany's most renowned quality manufacturers, with its own research and development department in Berlin. For the continuous improvement of our products, we collaborate with selected research institutes, scientists, therapists, farmers, and professional associations.
  

  

**We take our ecological responsibility very seriously:** that’s why the majority of our product range is vegan. We also take an innovative approach to packaging: most of our products are packaged in glass, making them almost entirely recyclable.  

  

Our diverse team in Berlin consists of over 350 employees from more than 40 nationalities and continues to grow – but at a sustainable pace. Our goal is to foster a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive work environment with a diverse group of motivated, talented, and visionary team members.  

  

*We highly value equality of opportunity and inclusivity, and we would like to particularly encourage women and candidates from under\\-represented backgrounds to apply, even if you don’t match with 100% of the requirements.*",False,"","","","","","","https://de.indeed.com/cmp/Sunday-Natural","",""

**Turn Dunia's experimental output into an understanding that drives better decisions**  

Dunia is building AI for one of the hardest unsolved problems in science: turning materials discovery from an academic, trial\\-and\\-error process into a programmable, scalable discipline.  

  

We run high\\-throughput experiments, simulations, and ML\\-driven optimization loops. The hardest problem is not generating data, and as our lab throughput increases, so does our data output. It is knowing what that data actually means.  

  

As Chemical Data Scientist, you will sit at the center of Dunia’s discovery loop. You will be the person who spots the signal from the noise, and whether a trend is real or misleading. You will ensure that the organization, its systems and models are actually learning.  

  

This role is about judgment as much as analysis. You will shape how experimental evidence flows into models, simulations, and decisions, and in doing so, how fast and how well Dunia discovers new materials.

 **Your tasks will include:**

*Be the scientific sense\\-maker*  

* Interrogate data from ongoing electrocatalyst campaigns
* Identifypatterns, anomalies, and failure modes that others miss
* Develop intuition for where experiments lie, and where they tell the truth

*Close the loop between matter and models*  

* Decide which experimental signals should inform ML feature design
* Decide which experimental signals and discrepancies are important enough to merit computationalexplanation.
* Give lab/automation teams concrete feedback on experimental quality and design

*Make learning compound, not fragment*  

* Create clear, concise digests that align the entire team on what was learned
* Track how understanding evolves across campaigns, not just within them
* Raise the bar for how scientific progress is communicated internally

*Influence the system, not just the analysis*  

* Shape data pipelines and analytical views by using them aggressively
* Help define what “analysis\\-ready” dataactually meansin practice
* Ensure infrastructure evolves aroundreal scientificworkflows, not abstractions

#### **Your profile**

* Master's or PhD in chemistry, electrochemistry, materials science, or a related field
* 3–6 years of experience working with experimental or computational data in a research or R\\&D context (post\\-Master's; fewer years post\\-PhD is fine)
* Strong Python skills and comfort with data analysis tooling (pandas,numpy, scikit\\-learn, etc.)
* Familiarity with electrochemistry or energymaterials.Youshould have intuition for what experimental artifacts look like and which trends are chemically meaningful
* Clear technical communication: you can write a summary that a lab scientist, an ML engineer, and a program manager can all use
* Bonus: exposure to tools likeRDKit,pymatgen, or ASE; familiarity with MongoDB or similar databases
* English fluency

"Cloud-Security und Insider-Bedrohungen: Drei kritische Entwicklungen für Geschäftsführer 01.02.2026","030-IT GmbH","Berlin, BE, DE","","indeed","2026-02-04","https://de.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=7b0a0fe0b95e028e","https://www.030-it.de/node/219","**Cloud\\-Security und Insider\\-Bedrohungen:** Drei kritische Entwicklungen für Geschäftsführer
  
Die wichtigsten Erkenntnisse auf einen Blick
  
**ShinyHunters\\-Angriffswelle:** Cyberkriminelle nutzen gezieltes Voice\\-Phishing und gefälschte SSO\\-Login\\-Seiten, um Cloud\\-Daten zu stehlen – Ihr Unternehmen könnte das nächste Ziel sein
  
**Microsoft beendet NTLM\\-Protokoll:** Eine 30 Jahre alte Authentifizierungstechnologie wird abgeschaltet – Handlungsbedarf für alle Windows\\-Umgebungen bis Ende 2026
  
**Verurteilung eines Google\\-Ingenieurs wegen KI\\-Datendiebstahl:** Ein Ex\\-Mitarbeiter verkaufte sensible KI\\-Technologie an chinesische Firmen – Insider\\-Risiken werden zur Chefsache
  
**E\\-Evidence\\-Gesetz verabschiedet:** Internationale Ermittler erhalten vereinfachten Zugriff auf Cloud\\-Daten – Neue Compliance\\-Anforderungen für Unternehmen
  
**Gesundheitswesen im Fokus:** Sicherheitslücken bei elektronischen Heilberufsausweisen erfordern Kartentausch – Kritische Infrastrukturen unter Druck
  
Warum diese Entwicklungen Ihre Aufmerksamkeit verdienen
  
  

Die vergangenen 48 Stunden haben drei zentrale Schwachstellen in der modernen Unternehmens\\-IT offengelegt: Cloud\\-Zugänge, veraltete Authentifizierungssysteme und Insider\\-Bedrohungen. Für Geschäftsführer und IT\\-Entscheider bedeutet dies: Wer jetzt nicht handelt, riskiert Datenverluste, Compliance\\-Verstöße und Reputationsschäden.
  
  

**1\\. ShinyHunters\\-Angriffswelle:** Wenn Cloud\\-Sicherheit zur Illusion wird
  
  

**Die Bedrohung:** Die Hackergruppe ShinyHunters hat ihre Angriffstaktik perfektioniert. Laut aktuellen Analysen von Mandiant nutzen die Kriminellen eine Kombination aus Voice\\-Phishing (Vishing) und täuschend echten, unternehmensgebrandeten Phishing\\-Seiten, um Single\\-Sign\\-On\\-Credentials (SSO) und Multi\\-Faktor\\-Authentifizierung\\-Codes (MFA) zu stehlen. Sobald sie Zugang haben, exfiltrieren sie massenhaft Daten aus SaaS\\-Anwendungen.
  
  

**Der Business\\-Impact:**  

**Datenverlust:** Kundendaten, Geschäftsgeheimnisse und geistiges Eigentum können innerhalb von Stunden abfließen
  
**Compliance\\-Risiken:** DSGVO\\-Verstöße können Bußgelder von bis zu 4% des weltweiten Jahresumsatzes nach sich ziehen
  
**Reputationsschaden:** Öffentlich gewordene Datenlecks führen zu Vertrauensverlust bei Kunden und Partnern
  
**Betriebsunterbrechungen:** Kompromittierte Cloud\\-Systeme müssen oft tagelang vom Netz genommen werden
  
  

**Was Entscheider jetzt tun müssen:**  

**Phishing\\-Resistente MFA einführen:** Setzen Sie auf Hardware\\-Tokens (FIDO2/WebAuthn) statt SMS\\- oder App\\-basierter MFA – diese sind nicht durch Phishing kompromittierbar
  
**Security Awareness intensivieren:** Schulen Sie Mitarbeiter speziell zu Voice\\-Phishing – Angreifer geben sich am Telefon als IT\\-Support aus
  
**Zero\\-Trust\\-Architektur implementieren:** Selbst mit gültigen Credentials sollten Zugriffe auf sensible Daten zusätzlich verifiziert werden
  
**Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) einsetzen:** Überwachen Sie abnormale Zugriffsmuster auf Cloud\\-Anwendungen in Echtzeit
  
  

**ROI\\-Perspektive:** Die Investition in phishing\\-resistente MFA (ca. 50\\-100 € pro Mitarbeiter) ist minimal im Vergleich zu den durchschnittlichen Kosten eines Datenlecks (4,45 Millionen US\\-Dollar laut IBM Security Report 2025\\).
  
  

**2\\. Microsoft beendet NTLM:** Modernisierung wird zur Pflicht
  
  

**Die Veränderung:** Microsoft hat angekündigt, das 30 Jahre alte NTLM\\-Authentifizierungsprotokoll in zukünftigen Windows\\-Versionen standardmäßig zu deaktivieren. Grund sind gravierende Sicherheitslücken, die Unternehmen anfällig für Cyberangriffe machen.
  
  

**Der Business\\-Impact:**  

**Legacy\\-Systeme gefährdet:** Viele ältere Anwendungen und Geräte (Drucker, Scanner, NAS\\-Systeme) nutzen noch NTLM
  
**Migrationsdruck:** Unternehmen müssen bis Ende 2026 auf Kerberos oder moderne Authentifizierungsmethoden umstellen
  
**Projektkosten:** Die Migration kann je nach Infrastruktur\\-Komplexität 50\\.000 bis 500\\.000 € kosten
  
**Betriebsrisiken:** Ohne rechtzeitige Umstellung drohen Systemausfälle nach Windows\\-Updates
  
  

**Was Entscheider jetzt tun müssen:**  

**Bestandsaufnahme durchführen:** Identifizieren Sie alle Systeme, die noch NTLM verwenden (Microsoft bietet Audit\\-Tools)
  
**Migrationsplan erstellen:** Priorisieren Sie kritische Systeme und planen Sie die Umstellung auf Kerberos oder Azure AD
  
**Budget einplanen:** Kalkulieren Sie Kosten für Hardware\\-Upgrades, Software\\-Lizenzen und externe Beratung
  
**Testumgebung aufbauen:** Validieren Sie die NTLM\\-Deaktivierung in einer isolierten Umgebung, bevor Sie produktiv gehen
  
  

**Wettbewerbsvorteil:** Unternehmen, die frühzeitig auf moderne Authentifizierung umstellen, reduzieren nicht nur Sicherheitsrisiken, sondern schaffen auch die Basis für Cloud\\-Migration und hybride Arbeitsmodelle.
  
  

**3\\. Insider\\-Bedrohungen:** Der Fall des Google\\-Ingenieurs
  
  

**Der Vorfall:** Ein ehemaliger Google\\-Software\\-Ingenieur wurde verurteilt, weil er sensible Daten über KI\\-Supercomputer\\-Technologie gestohlen und an chinesische Tech\\-Firmen weitergegeben hatte. Der Fall zeigt: Die größte Bedrohung kommt oft von innen.
  
  

**Der Business\\-Impact:**  

**Verlust von Wettbewerbsvorteilen:** Gestohlenes geistiges Eigentum kann Konkurrenten Jahre an Entwicklungszeit ersparen
  
**Rechtliche Konsequenzen:** Neben Strafverfahren drohen zivilrechtliche Klagen und Schadensersatzforderungen
  
**Vertrauensverlust:** Investoren und Partner verlieren das Vertrauen in die Sicherheitskultur des Unternehmens
  
**Regulatorische Prüfungen:** Behörden können verschärfte Auflagen verhängen
  
  

**Was Entscheider jetzt tun müssen:**  

**Data Loss Prevention (DLP) implementieren:** Überwachen Sie, welche Daten Mitarbeiter auf externe Geräte oder Cloud\\-Dienste übertragen
  
**Privileged Access Management (PAM):** Beschränken Sie den Zugriff auf sensible Systeme nach dem Need\\-to\\-Know\\-Prinzip
  
**Offboarding\\-Prozesse verschärfen:** Entziehen Sie ausscheidenden Mitarbeitern sofort alle Zugriffsrechte
  
**Whistleblower\\-Programme etablieren:** Schaffen Sie sichere Kanäle, über die Mitarbeiter verdächtiges Verhalten melden können
  
**Regelmäßige Audits:** Überprüfen Sie Zugriffsrechte und Datenflüsse quartalsweise
  
  

**Compliance\\-Relevanz:** Mit NIS2 und dem EU Cyber Resilience Act werden Insider\\-Risiken zunehmend zur regulatorischen Anforderung. Unternehmen müssen nachweisen, dass sie angemessene Schutzmaßnahmen implementiert haben.
  
  

**4\\. E\\-Evidence\\-Gesetz:** Neue Spielregeln für Cloud\\-Daten
  
  

**Die Regulierung:** Der Bundestag hat die Umsetzung der EU\\-E\\-Evidence\\-Verordnung beschlossen. Ermittlungsbehörden können nun schneller und direkter auf in der Cloud gespeicherte Daten zugreifen – auch über Ländergrenzen hinweg.
  
  

**Der Business\\-Impact:**  

**Reduzierter Rechtsschutz:** Kritiker bemängeln Lücken beim Rechtsschutz und erhöhte Missbrauchsrisiken
  
**Compliance\\-Komplexität:** Unternehmen müssen sicherstellen, dass sie Behördenanfragen rechtskonform bearbeiten
  
**Datensouveränität:** Die Frage, wo Daten gespeichert werden, wird noch wichtiger
  
**Kundenvertrauen:** Kunden erwarten Transparenz darüber, wie ihre Daten geschützt werden
  
  

**Was Entscheider jetzt tun müssen:**  

**Datenlokalisierung prüfen:** Evaluieren Sie, ob sensible Daten in EU\\-Rechenzentren gespeichert werden sollten
  
**Verschlüsselung ausbauen:** End\\-to\\-End\\-Verschlüsselung schützt Daten auch bei Behördenzugriff
  
**Transparenzberichte veröffentlichen:** Informieren Sie Kunden über Behördenanfragen (soweit rechtlich zulässig)
  
**Rechtsberatung einholen:** Klären Sie mit Anwälten, wie Sie auf E\\-Evidence\\-Anfragen reagieren müssen
  
**5\\. Gesundheitswesen:** Sicherheitslücken bei elektronischen Heilberufsausweisen
  
  

**Das Problem:** Kunden von D\\-Trust und SHC\\+Care müssen ihre bereits ECC\\-fähigen elektronischen Heilberufsausweise (eHBA) aufgrund einer Sicherheitslücke austauschen. Die genaue Anzahl betroffener Karten ist unklar.
  
  

**Der Business\\-Impact für Gesundheitseinrichtungen:**  

**Betriebsunterbrechungen:** Ohne gültige eHBA können Ärzte keine elektronischen Rezepte ausstellen
  
**Compliance\\-Risiken:** Die Telematikinfrastruktur (TI) ist gesetzlich vorgeschrieben
  
**Patientensicherheit:** Verzögerungen bei der Medikamentenversorgung sind möglich
  
**Reputationsschaden:** Sicherheitslücken im Gesundheitswesen werden medial stark beachtet
  
  

**Was Entscheider im Gesundheitswesen jetzt tun müssen:**  

**Betroffenheit prüfen:** Kontaktieren Sie Ihren eHBA\\-Anbieter und klären Sie, ob Ihre Karten betroffen sind
  
**Austauschprozess beschleunigen:** Fordern Sie neue Karten umgehend an, um Betriebsunterbrechungen zu vermeiden
  
**Notfallpläne aktivieren:** Stellen Sie sicher, dass alternative Prozesse (z.B. Papierrezepte) funktionieren
  
**IT\\-Sicherheitsaudits intensivieren:** Überprüfen Sie auch andere Komponenten der Telematikinfrastruktur
  
  

**NIS2\\-Relevanz:** Krankenhäuser und Gesundheitseinrichtungen fallen unter die NIS2\\-Richtlinie. Sicherheitsvorfälle müssen binnen 24 Stunden gemeldet werden – Bußgelder bei Verstößen können bis zu 10 Millionen Euro betragen.
  
  

Handlungsempfehlungen für Geschäftsführer
  
  

**Kurzfristig (nächste 4 Wochen):**  

**Security\\-Assessment beauftragen:** Lassen Sie Ihre Cloud\\-Zugänge, Authentifizierungsmethoden und Insider\\-Risiken von externen Experten prüfen
  
**Notfall\\-Response\\-Plan aktualisieren:** Stellen Sie sicher, dass Ihr Incident\\-Response\\-Team auf ShinyHunters\\-ähnliche Angriffe vorbereitet ist
  
**NTLM\\-Bestandsaufnahme starten:** Identifizieren Sie alle Systeme, die noch NTLM verwenden
  
  

**Mittelfristig (nächste 3\\-6 Monate):**  

**Phishing\\-resistente MFA ausrollen:** Migrieren Sie von SMS/App\\-basierter MFA auf Hardware\\-Tokens
  
**DLP\\- und PAM\\-Lösungen implementieren:** Schützen Sie sich gegen Insider\\-Bedrohungen
  
**NTLM\\-Migration planen:** Erstellen Sie einen detaillierten Migrationsplan mit Budget und Zeitplan
  
  

**Langfristig (nächste 12 Monate):**  

**Zero\\-Trust\\-Architektur aufbauen:** Implementieren Sie ein umfassendes Zero\\-Trust\\-Modell für Ihre gesamte IT\\-Infrastruktur
  
**NIS2\\-Compliance sicherstellen:** Bereiten Sie sich auf die verschärften Meldepflichten und Sicherheitsanforderungen vor
  
**Security\\-Kultur etablieren:** Machen Sie IT\\-Sicherheit zur Chefsache und verankern Sie sie in der Unternehmenskultur
  
**Fazit:** Sicherheit als Wettbewerbsvorteil
  
  

**Die aktuellen Entwicklungen zeigen:** IT\\-Sicherheit ist keine rein technische Angelegenheit mehr, sondern eine strategische Führungsaufgabe. Unternehmen, die jetzt in moderne Authentifizierung, Cloud\\-Security und Insider\\-Schutz investieren, schützen nicht nur ihre Daten – sie schaffen auch Vertrauen bei Kunden, Partnern und Investoren.
  
  

Die Kosten für Prävention sind dabei deutlich geringer als die Kosten eines Sicherheitsvorfalls. Ein durchschnittlicher Datenleck kostet laut IBM Security Report 4,45 Millionen US\\-Dollar – die Investition in phishing\\-resistente MFA, DLP und moderne Authentifizierung liegt bei einem Bruchteil davon.
  
  

**Die Botschaft ist klar:** Wer Sicherheit als Kostenfaktor betrachtet, hat bereits verloren. Wer sie als Investition in die Zukunftsfähigkeit des Unternehmens versteht, gewinnt Wettbewerbsvorteile.

We’re hiring a **Forward Deployed Engineer (Infrastructure)** to work directly with our strategic customers.

#### **Why deepset**


At deepset, we’re on a mission to make custom AI solutions accessible to every organization.

You’ll collaborate with top\\-tier tech talent, tackle meaningful challenges, and help transform complex AI into solutions that are simple, powerful, and ready for the real world.

#### **What you will do**


Design \\& Land

* Own technical outcomes from POC production: integrations, data connectors, workflows, and infra\\-as\\-code (Kubernetes/Terraform/Helm).
* Produce reference architectures and reusable templates; upstream patterns to Product to reduce future “custom” work.
* Unblock enterprise environments: identity (OIDC/SAML), networking, storage, GPU scheduling, observability hooks.

  

Run \\& Harden

* Define SLOs/Error Budgets with customers; implement end\\-to\\-end observability (logs/metrics/traces) and dashboards.
* Create runbooks/playbooks; lead L3 incident response and RCAs; drive reliability roadmaps to closure.
* Plan/execute upgrades and security patches in change windows; ensure rollback and post\\-upgrade verification.
* Be an active member of the on\\-call rotation to make sure we deliver excellent customer experience

  

Partner \\& Enable

* Train customer teams on operations and emergency procedures; hand off cleanly to Support/CSM.
* Prioritize reliability and “productization” backlog with Product/Engineering based on field signal.
* Document clearly: setup guides, diagrams, SLOs, testing/DR procedures, and “golden path” standards.

#### **Requirements**

Karla is transforming the post\\-purchase experience in e\\-commerce. Our platform helps online merchants turn delivery tracking into a revenue\\-generating channel while dramatically reducing customer anxiety and support costs.  

Founded in Berlin and backed by €3\\.4M in pre\\-seed funding, we're scaling rapidly across Europe. We integrate with 1000\\+ carriers and power millions of deliveries for hundreds of merchants. We're at an inflection point and looking for exceptional engineers to help us grow.

#### **About the Role**


We're looking for a **Senior Software Engineer** to join **Karla’s** engineering team and build end\\-to\\-end solutions that power the post\\-purchase experience for renowned international brands.  

As a Senior Software Engineer, you'll take ownership of complete features from conception to production. You'll leverage modern tools and AI\\-powered workflows to accelerate development while maintaining high\\-quality standards.  

You'll have the autonomy to architect solutions within your domain and ship code with confidence backed by comprehensive testing.

* **Collaborate cross\\-functionally** with product and design to deliver cohesive solutions.
* **Drive technical decisions** within your domain, balancing pragmatism with long\\-term sustainability.
* **Improve developer experience** by championing better tooling, automation, and AI\\-augmented workflows.

 **What Success Looks Like**  

* **First 3 Months**
	+ Ramp up quickly on our codebase, architecture, and development workflows, leveraging AI to explore and understand the systems faster.
	+ Ship 3\\-5 complete features to production, spanning multiple layers of the stack.
	+ Contribute high\\-quality code reviews with constructive technical feedback.
	+ Build strong working relationships across engineering, product, and design teams.
* **First 6 Months**
	+ Own end\\-to\\-end delivery of major features, from database design through API implementation to user interface.
	+ Drive meaningful improvements to system performance, reliability, or developer experience.
	+ Contribute to architectural decisions and influence technical direction.
	+ Become productive across the full stack, comfortable making changes anywhere in the codebase.
* **First Year**
	+ Be a go\\-to resource for complex problems spanning the entire system.
	+ Lead initiatives that significantly improve code quality, system architecture, or team velocity.
	+ Demonstrate consistent high output by effectively combining deep technical work with AI\\-augmented productivity.
	+ Operate autonomously with minimal guidance, making sound technical decisions that balance speed and sustainability.

#### **About You**

**Collaboration \\& Growth*** Works effectively across teams (product, design, sales…) and other engineers.
* Clear communicator who explains technical trade\\-offs in code reviews and design discussions.
* Breaks down complex problems into manageable pieces and unblocks others.
* Shares knowledge about modern development practices.
* Continuously learns and adapts to new technologies and workflows.

#### **The Benefits**

**Impact**

* **Transform e\\-commerce at scale**: Your code directly powers delivery experiences for hundreds of online merchants and millions of end customers across Europe.

Reflex Aerospace is at the forefront of propelling high\\-performance satellite technology to new heights within the German aerospace landscape.  

As part of Reflex Aerospace, you will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of the space industry's future. This is an opportunity to contribute your expertise and enthusiasm to a team that stands for innovation and excellence. If you are ready to take on exciting challenges and be part of a company that is redefining the boundaries of satellite technology, we welcome you to embark on this thrilling journey with us!  

  

**Please submit your CV in English, as not everyone on the hiring team is fluent in German.**

#### **Your Mission:**


You’ll help us improve how we build, test, and ship embedded software. This is a hands\\-on role for someone who enjoys Linux, scripting, and debugging build systems. You’ll work closely with experienced engineers, get code reviews and mentorship, and own small projects that grow over time.  

  

What you’ll do:

  

* Maintain and improve our Linux\\-based CI/CD environment (GitLab CI): investigate failures, improve reliability, and reduce build times.
* Write automation in Bash/Python to support builds, releases, reports, and internal tooling.
* Support our on\\-prem / local development infrastructure using Ansible (provisioning, configuration, repeatability).
* Improve artifact handling: versioning, packaging, traceability, and publishing.
* Help strengthen security basics in CI/Infrastructure (secrets handling, access controls, hardening steps).
* Support simulation/test environments to speed up development feedback loops.


First 90 days: goals \\& expected outcomes:  

* You can confidently navigate Linux systems, troubleshoot CI failures, and explain what broke and why.
* You ship 1–2 meaningful improvements to pipelines (e.g., reduce flaky jobs, speed up a stage, improve caching).
* You deliver an automation script or Ansible role that removes manual steps for the team.
* You contribute documentation that makes the system easier to operate and onboard to.

#### **Your Background:**


Must\\-have (we’ll test and interview for these):

  

* Strong Linux fundamentals: Shell usage, processes, permissions, networking basics, logs.
* Strong Bash: Writing reliable scripts (error handling, quoting, exit codes), not just one\\-liners.
* Strong Git: Branching, rebasing/merging, resolving conflicts, understanding history and tags.
* A debugging mindset: You can reproduce issues, narrow root cause, and communicate clearly.


Nice\\-to\\-have (we can teach these):  

* Docker/container basics and how they affect CI builds.
* Ansible or infrastructure\\-as\\-code experience (even small personal projects count).
* Basic security hygiene: secrets management, least privilege, SSH key handling.
* Exposure to embedded/firmware workflows or curiosity about build systems and simulators.


How we work:  

* Mentorship, pairing, and code reviews are part of the job.
* We value documentation and making systems understandable.
* You’ll get ownership of real improvements early, with support from senior engineers.


Application note:  

* This role is ideal for someone who has spent a lot of time in Linux terminals (home lab, internships, projects) and can explain Git history/merges confidently.
* First Interview includes a practical exercise in Git \\+ Linux \\+ Bash.

#### **What We Offer:**

* Collaborate with a diverse multinational team crafting the next wave of cutting\\-edge satellites. Embark on this exciting journey with us from the outset, leaving your indelible mark on a dynamic company and playing a direct role in shaping the future of the space industry.
* Keep your energy levels high with company\\-sponsored memberships for Urban Sports Club.
* We provide a hybrid work model along with flexible working hours, empowering you as the owner of your time management.
* Nestled in the heart of Friedrichshain, our Berlin office provides a lively and central hub easily accessible by transit. Immerse yourself in a neighborhood teeming with vibrant restaurants and year\\-round cultural events.
* Enjoy the flexibility of ample vacation time, including a special company holiday on April 12th dedicated to celebrating the International Day of Human Spaceflight.


Join Reflex Aerospace and be a driving force in shaping the next era of space exploration!  

We look for your application.#### **About us**

ONIQ is on a mission to transform manufacturing for a more sustainable and efficient future. With the IQA Lean Copilot, we are pioneering a new category in industrial tech \\- combining lean production principles with AI, process mining, and advanced data analytics. Our software empowers manufacturers to systematically identify inefficiencies, accelerate improvements, and scale operational excellence across their global production networks.  

  

We are a highly motivated team with a strong sense of ownership and passion for what we do. Our entrepreneurial mindset and commitment to innovation have enabled us to grow fast and shape the future of digital lean and green manufacturing. At ONIQ, culture is just as important as product. We foster an environment rooted in authenticity, diversity, integrity, and mutual respect \\- where everyone is encouraged to bring their whole self to work.

#### **What you will do**


As **Lead DevOps Engineer**, you will be the **technical owner** of our multi\\-cloud infrastructure and data strategy. You’ll have real decision\\-making authority over our cloud architecture, infrastructure roadmap, and data engineering approach as we scale to serve more Fortune 500 enterprises.  

  

This is a **hands\\-on leadership role**. You lead through expertise rather than hierarchy: you design, build, and operate key systems yourself while setting the technical direction. You’ll work directly with our founding and senior development team to make critical build\\-vs\\-buy decisions, define our infrastructure evolution over the coming years, and establish the foundations that enable our platform and team to scale reliably.  

  

**Infrastructure Strategy \\& Architecture**

* Define and execute our multi\\-cloud infrastructure roadmap, making key decisions on technology selection and architecture patterns
* Own the technical strategy for our Kubernetes\\-based deployment infrastructure and IaC approach across Google Cloud, Azure, AWS, and on\\-premise deployments
* Build, deploy, and monitor container\\-based services using IaC in diverse client\\-provisioned Fortune 500 production environments
* Interface with enterprise customers technical teams on deployment and infrastructure requirements and rollout plans

**DevOps Leadership**  

* Engineer the DevOps tooling and automation layers that streamline our data onboarding, allowing us to ingest heterogeneous customer data with minimal manual effort
* Own our infrastructure strategy including data (object storage, OLTP/OLAP, caching), CI/CD and orchestration
* Develop and optimise APIs and data processing systems using Python (Polars/FastAPI) to benefit from your infrastructure decisions

**Cross\\-Functional Collaboration**  

* Partner with product and engineering leadership to translate business requirements into robust infrastructure capabilities
* Research and evaluate emerging technologies, making clear recommendations on when and how to adopt new tools

#### **What we expect from you**

**Experience \\& Technical Depth**

  

* 6\\+ years in software engineering, cloud infrastructure, or backend/data engineering roles, with a primary focus on Cloud Infrastructure/DevOps and Python proficiency and at least 2 years in a senior technical capacity where you made architectural decisions
* Deep, hands\\-on expertise with Kubernetes, major cloud providers (Google Cloud, Azure, AWS), and IaC frameworks (Terraform, OpenTofu, Pulumi)
* Strong Python skills with modern data processing libraries (e.g. Polars) and API frameworks (FastAPI, etc.). Experience with TypeScript/React or Rust is a plus, not a requirement

**Strategic Thinking \\& Ownership**  

* Track record of making significant architectural decisions and seeing them through to production at scale.
* Strong sense of ownership – you care about outcomes, not just outputs, and you’re happy to roll up your sleeves.
* You prefer **deep impact and technical leadership** over pure people management.

**Mission \\& Mindset**  

* Genuine interest in industrial manufacturing and B2B SaaS – we’re solving real problems for customers making physical products
* Entrepreneurial mindset: you enjoy building foundational systems that will support company growth over years
* Excellent organisational and communication skills – you can articulate complex technical decisions to non\\-technical stakeholders
* Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field, or equivalent practical experience

**Location**  

* We love the energy that comes from working together in person, so spending time at our Cologne or Berlin office matters to us. One on\\-site day per week is the minimum, and more time together is always welcome

#### **What we offer**

* True technical ownership with decision\\-making authority over infrastructure strategy
* Direct impact on our ability to serve manufacturing customers and scale the platform
* A culture built on transparency, integrity and authenticity – we trust and respect each other and make decisions based on competence

You’ll think globally when building systems, ensuring we build high performing, scalable systems that fit well together. We are looking for pragmatic visionaries who can translate customer needs into workable technology solutions.

You will balance technical leadership and savvy with strong business judgment to make the right decisions about technology choices. You will own the architecture, existing and future, for Aurora storage layer. You will share your updates with AWS leadership, get buy\\-in, and work with all stakeholder teams to maintain industry leadership. You will be the default mentor for all engineers on the team, establish and demand best practices through your engineering leadership. You will immerse yourself in your team’s entire software development lifecycle to have a hands\\-on impact. You’ll strive for simplicity, and demonstrate significant creativity and high judgment.

* Experience with event\\-driven architectures using message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SNS/SQS)
* Proficiency in RESTful API design, including versioning, documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger), and rate limiting
* Strong testing mindset (JUnit, Mockito), plus integration and contract testing (Pact)
* Familiarity with Docker and Kubernetes, including deployment strategies and service mesh concepts

Ständige Veränderungen und Unsicherheit sind die Konstanten der Welt, in der wir leben. Erfolg entsteht in Unternehmen, die in der Lage sind, die eigentlichen Ursachen von Problemen zu identifizieren, tragfähige fachliche und technische Lösungen zu entwickeln und diese in digitale Produkte und Prozesse mit messbarem Mehrwert zu überführen.  

Deshalb suchen wir dich: eine Person, die Probleme nicht nur benennt, sondern löst. Du gehst den Ursachen auf den Grund, strukturierst Lösungsräume und verbindest Business und Technologie, um beim Kunden und bei uns intern spürbare Wirkung zu erzielen.


Auch wenn bestehende Systemlandschaften komplex sind, Anforderungen unklar bleiben oder technische Rahmenbedingungen einschränken – du behältst einen kühlen Kopf, triffst fundierte Entscheidungen und packst auch dort an, wo es kleinteilig wird. Denn du weißt, worauf es ankommt: gemeinsam mit dem Team Lösungen zu finden und dabei nicht nur das Was, sondern immer auch das Warum im Blick zu behalten.


Deine Unterstützung benötigen wir unter anderem bei der

* Analyse von Geschäftsprozessen, Anforderungen und Problemstellungen auf operativer wie strategischer Ebene unter Berücksichtigung technischer Rahmenbedingungen
* Übersetzung von Kundenzielen und \\-bedürfnissen in realisierbare Produkt\\- und Lösungsansätze mit klarer Vision, nachvollziehbaren Prioritäten und eindeutigen Akzeptanzkriterien
* Strukturierung und Priorisierung von Backlogs unter Abwägung von Business Value, technischer Komplexität und langfristiger Wartbarkeit
* Enge Zusammenarbeit mit Softwarearchitekten und Entwicklungsteams bei der Ausgestaltung von System\\- und Produktlösungen, insbesondere im Hinblick auf Datenmodelle, Schnittstellen, Integrationen und Abhängigkeiten
* Entwicklung, Bewertung und Weiterentwicklung von Geschäftsmodellen, Wertversprechen und Produktideen gemeinsam mit Stakeholdern aus Fachbereich, IT und Management
* Arbeit an zentralen Schnittstellen: zwischen Strategie und Umsetzung, zwischen Idee und Produkt, zwischen Kunde und Organisation


In diese und viele weitere Aufgabenbereiche kannst du deine Erfahrung in Business Analyse, Produktentwicklung und technischer Konzeption bei uns einbringen.

#### **Deine Rollen**


Business Analyst \\| Product Owner \\| Product Manager \\| Requirements Engineer \\| Business Designer (m/w/d)


Wir suchen Menschen, die nicht nur eine Rolle ausüben, sondern bereit sind, Verantwortung zu übernehmen, anzupacken und über den Tellerrand hinauszublicken.

#### **Dein Profil**

* Die Fähigkeit, aus unterschiedlichen Perspektiven und Interessen eine gemeinsame Richtung zu entwickeln, diese mit Überzeugung zu vertreten und so Entscheidungen herbeizuführen und Begeisterung zu erzeugen
* Ausgeprägtes analytisches Denkvermögen und Freude daran, komplexe fachliche und technische Zusammenhänge schnell zu erfassen, um sie verständlich zu strukturieren und zu vermitteln
* Starkes Verständnis für Kundenziele und \\-bedürfnisse sowie für wirtschaftliche Zusammenhänge, um Probleme im Gesamtkontext einzuordnen, Prioritäten zu setzen und Entscheidungen auf Basis von Nutzen, Risiko und Aufwand zu treffen – auch unter Unsicherheit
* Die Fähigkeit, technische Optionen zu bewerten und deren Auswirkungen auf Business Value, Time\\-to\\-Market und Wartbarkeit abzuschätzen, um fundierte Entscheidungen zu treffen oder vorzubereiten
* Erfahrung in der Analyse und Strukturierung fachlicher Anforderungen in komplexen Systemlandschaften unter Berücksichtigung von Softwarearchitektur, Datenmodellen und Integrationsmustern
* Sehr gute Kommunikationsfähigkeit und Empathie im Umgang mit unterschiedlichen Stakeholdern an der Schnittstelle zwischen Business, IT und Management
* Selbständiges, proaktives und verantwortungsbewusstes Arbeiten sowie die Bereitschaft, sich auch in neue fachliche und technische Themen einzuarbeiten
* Erfahrung in der Geschäftsmodellentwicklung, Produktstrategie und im Produktmanagement sowie in der Zusammenarbeit mit Entwicklungsteams
* Neugier und Lernbereitschaft sowie Freude daran, Annahmen zu hinterfragen, Hypothesen zu testen und aus Feedback zu lernen
* Sehr gute Deutsch\\- und Englischkenntnisse in Wort und Schrift


Du erfüllst nicht jeden Punkt? Kein Problem. Wenn du bereit bist, Verantwortung zu übernehmen, dich aktiv in neue Themen einzuarbeiten und dich bewusst anspruchsvollen Problemstellungen zu stellen, freuen wir uns auf deine Bewerbung.

#### **Warum wir?**


Wir verstehen das Team als den einzigen Ort, an dem exzellente Ergebnisse in einer immer komplexer und dynamischer werdenden Welt entstehen können.  

Unser Team überzeugt durch Menschen, die Verantwortung übernehmen.  

Mit unseren unterschiedlichen Charakteren, sich gegenseitig ergänzenden Kompetenzen und breit gefächerten Erfahrungen nehmen wir jede Herausforderung motiviert an.  

  

Dabei sind uns die folgenden Werte in unserer Zusammenarbeit besonders wichtig:

* **Verbundenheit:** Wir verstehen uns als Gemeinschaft und unterstützen uns gegenseitig. Bei Entscheidungen berücksichtigen wir die vielfältigen Sichtweisen und Bedürfnisse aller felloworker.
* **Aufrichtigkeit:** Wir sprechen unsere Gedanken klar und offen aus, ohne persönlich zu werden. Wir meinen Dinge so, wie wir sie sagen und können uns auf das Wort der Anderen verlassen.
* **Selbstbestimmung:** Wir sehen unser Arbeitsumfeld nicht als gegeben an und können es flexibel gestalten. Dabei bestimmen wir selbst wie wir unsere Kompetenzen einsetzen, um für die Gemeinschaft den größten Mehrwert zu schaffen.
* **Mut:** Wir machen uns mögliche Konsequenzen unseres Handelns bewusst und übernehmen Verantwortung. Wir trauen uns zu scheitern, daraus zu lernen und unsere Erlebnisse zu teilen.
* **Wertschätzung:** Wir schätzen die Arbeit aller felloworker im Großen und im Kleinen und zeigen dies durch konstruktive Kritik. Wir urteilen nicht vorschnell, nehmen unser Gegenüber bewusst wahr und berücksichtigen das in unserem Handeln.

#### **Über uns**


Als kleine Beratungsboutique im Raum Karlsruhe pflegen wir ein familiäres und partnerschaftliches Miteinander im Team sowie mit unseren Kunden. Direkte Kommunikation und kurze Wege sind uns dabei besonders wichtig. Deshalb sind unsere Kunden und Projekte nah bei uns und wir sind nah bei ihnen. Ständiges Kofferpacken und Ein\\- und Auschecken gehört daher nicht zu unserem Alltag.  

  

Bei jedem Vorhaben geht es um Veränderungen, Erwartungen und Unsicherheiten. Ein gewisses Maß an emotionaler Intelligenz ist für uns deshalb ebenso Grundvoraussetzung wie eine zielgerichtete Kommunikationsfähigkeit. Darüber hinaus sind uns eine schnelle Auffassungsgabe sowie analytisches und unternehmerisches Denken sehr wichtig, um die komplexen Zusammenhänge, die uns begegnen, schnell zu verstehen und in der Beratung gemeinsam erfolgreich zu sein. Wer also die Abwechslung liebt, sich gern täglich neuen Herausforderungen eigenverantwortlich stellt und mehr als nur eine Organisation kennenlernen möchte, ist bei uns goldrichtig.  

  

Was für uns zählt, ist Persönlichkeit!

**Das Unternehmen und deine Rolle**
-----------------------------------


Die Institutional Investment Group (2IG) ist eine der führenden unabhängigen Investmentplattformen für Immobilien und Real Assets in Deutschland und Europa. Mit ca. 350 Mitarbeitern verwaltet die 2IG ein Vermögen von mehr als 40 Milliarden Euro in ca. 25 Ländern und nimmt damit eine marktführende Position insbesondere als Investmentplattform von Immobilienvermögen ein.

**Vom Coder zum Creator: Gestalte die Zukunft der Softwareentwicklung mit KI**
  

Wir glauben, dass sich die Rolle des Softwareentwicklers fundamental wandelt. Du bist für uns nicht mehr derjenige, der Syntax tippt, sondern der Architekt, der die „Story“ der Software schreibt und die KI als mächtiges Werkzeug dirigiert. Wir suchen einen Experten, der im .NET\\-Ökosystem zu Hause ist, aber bereit ist, Grenzen einzureißen und mittels KI jede technologische Herausforderung zu meistern.**Deine Mission: AI Orchestration \\& Architecture**
---------------------------------------------------

Du programmierst nicht mehr nur, sondern lässt programmieren, veredelst das Ergebnis und wirst zur Schnittstelle zwischen menschlicher Intention und maschineller Ausführung.
* **Storytelling \\& Specification\\-Driven Development**: Du übersetzt komplexe fachliche Anforderungen in präzise technische Kontexte („Stories“ / Prompts), die unsere KI\\-Modelle in hochwertigen Code verwandeln.
* **AI\\-Assisted .NET Engineering**: Du nutzt dein tiefes Verständnis der .NET\\-Architektur, um KI\\-generierten Code zu validieren, zu optimieren und nahtlos in unsere Systemlandschaft zu integrieren.
* **Polyglot Exploration**: Während deine Basis .NET ist, nutzt du die KI, um technologische Barrieren zu überwinden. Du implementierst bei Bedarf Lösungen in anderen Sprachen (z.B. Python, Go, Rust), indem du deine Architektur\\-Skills mit der Syntax\\-Kompetenz der KI kombinierst.
* **Tooling \\& Enablement**: Du baust die „Werkbank der Zukunft“. Du entwickelst interne Tools und Services, die das gesamte Entwicklerteam befähigen, KI effizienter in ihrem Alltag zu nutzen.
* **Automatisierung \\& DevOps**: Du erstellst CI/CD\\-Pipelines (GitLab) und Container\\-Lösungen, damit der von Mensch und KI geschaffene Code sicher und schnell in Produktion geht.
**Dein Profil: Tiefes Fundament, neues Mindset**
------------------------------------------------

Wir suchen jemanden, der die Regeln so gut kennt, dass er weiß, wie man sie bricht und neu zusammensetzt.  

**Dein Fundament:**


* **Tiefgreifende .NET DNA**: Du hast mehrjährige Erfahrung mit C\\# / .NET und verstehst, was unter der Haube passiert (Memory Management, Async/Await, LINQ). Du hast ein geschultes Auge für Codequalität und erkennst Schwachstellen sofort, egal ob von einem Menschen oder einer KI.
* **Modernes Webdevelopment \\& Container**: Erfahrung mit Blazor, React sowie Docker und Kubernetes. Du weißt, wie moderne verteilte Anwendungen im .NET\\-Umfeld laufen.
* **DevOps Praktiker**: CI/CD (z.B. GitLab, Jenkins) ist für dich kein Fremdwort, sondern Teil deiner täglichen Routine.
  


**Dein Mindset:**


* **AI Story Bauer**: Du verstehst Prompt Engineering nicht als Spielerei, sondern als Engineering\\-Disziplin (Chain\\-of\\-Thought, Context\\-Window\\-Management). Du kannst Anforderungen so strukturieren, dass eine KI sie fehlerfrei umsetzt**.**
* **Architektur vor Syntax**: Du denkst in Systemen, Schnittstellen und Datenflüssen. Die Programmiersprache ist für dich nur ein Werkzeug, das dank KI austauschbar wird.
* **Kritischer Kurator**: Du nutzt KI bewusst und reflektiert. Dein geschulter Code‑Review‑Blick erkennt Fehlinterpretationen, Sicherheitsrisiken und logische Inkonsistenzen sofort.
* **Lernbereitschaft**: Du hast Lust, deine .NET\\-Komfortzone zu verlassen und dich von der KI in neue Tech\\-Stacks (Cloud Native, Python Data Services etc.) begleiten zu lassen.
**Warum wir?**
--------------


 VERGÜTUNGSPAKET
 Wir bieten ein ansprechendes Vergütungspaket, das Engagement auch monetär
 wertschätzt.

 FEEDBACK \\& ENTWICKLUNGSMÖGLICHKEIT
 Wir geben strukturiertes regelmäßiges Feedback, das es unseren KollegInnen
 erlaubt, sich auf der Stelle, aber auch im Unternehmen weiterzuentwickeln.

 GESTALTUNGSFREIRÄUME \\& OFFENHEIT  

 Wir geben Dir die Möglichkeit, Dich in Veränderungsprozesse einzubringen und diese aktiv  

 mitzugestalten. Unsere Kultur lebt „AI First“ nicht nur als Buzzword, sondern im täglichen  

 Arbeiten. Der Zugang zu Premium‑AI‑Tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT Enterprise, Claude  

 etc.) versteht sich dabei von selbst.

 FLEXIBLE ARBEITSZEITEN
 Ob Früh\\- oder Spätaufsteher oder Kita\\-Öffnungszeiten, wir sind grundsätzlich flexibel.
 Im Vordergrund steht für uns, dass die Arbeit erledigt wird und dass es im Team
 passt.

 DRESSCODE
 Bei uns gibt es keinen Dresscode, den es zu berücksichtigen gilt.

**Unser gemeinsamer Weg zur Zusammenarbeit**

Wenn es Dich reizt, unsere Unternehmensgruppe und unseren Erfolg aktiv mitzugestalten, freuen wir uns auf Deine Bewerbung, gerne mit Angabe Deines frühestmöglichen Eintrittstermins und Deiner Gehaltsvorstellung.

It’s true. At Mews, we dream big. As a Hotel Tech unicorn valued at $1\\.2b, we’re propelling new\\-generation cloud technology within global hospitality. With our industry\\-leading property management solution**,** we’re enabling the world’s most revolutionary hospitality brands to accelerate their digital transformation.



We’re on the lookout for ambitious, tenacious and passionate people who want to join the next generation of innovators and disrupt the hospitality industry with us. Sound good so far? Keep reading and tumble down the Mews rabbit hole... 



 ‍ #### **About the role**



First things first: you want to know what you’re actually applying for. It’s impossible to capture every nuance of a role – especially at a rapidly growing company like Mews – but if we had to distill it down to a job description (which we do because this is a job description), it would be this:



You’ll help build and run the platform that enables all Mews product teams to ship and operate software in production. This is a hands\\-on platform role focused on infrastructure, reliability and developer enablement. While this position is within Platform Engineering, we hire this profile across multiple platform teams.


#### **✅ Your mission, should you choose to accept it:**


* Building an opinionated cloud platform to enable other engineering teams to build their products in the cloud safely and efficiently without having to know all the details about every cloud service.
* Promoting a “you build it, you run it” culture. We aim to enable other engineering teams, rather than doing everything for them.
* Building and deploying reliable, resilient and scalable cloud resources using infrastructure as code.
* Ensuring the stability and resilience of our production systems and supporting other engineering teams to do the same for services they own.
* Creating CI/CD delivery pipelines so that engineers can focus on doing the job, not deploying it.
* Partnering with engineering teams to migrate and modernise existing products to the new platform.

 #### **️ You’ll be a great fit if you bring a few of the below with you:**



Platform engineering at Mews covers many areas. Experience with cloud infrastructure and infrastructure as code is essential but you don’t need to be an expert in everything. We expect candidates to be very experienced in two or three of these technical areas and have some experience with several others.


* Cloud infrastructure – Experience building and operating services in a public cloud environment. We use Azure, but AWS or GCP experience is also welcome. Our workload are containerised, but we do not currently use Kubernetes.
* Infrastructure as code – Familiarity with tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or AWS CDK.
* Observability – Understanding of monitoring practices using logs, metrics, and traces to ensure system reliability and performance.
* CI/CD – Experience designing or maintaining continuous integration and deployment pipelines to deliver software quickly and safely.
* Incident response – Comfortable responding to and learning from production issues as part of an on\\-call rota, with a focus on reliability and root cause analysis.
* Software development – We use C\\# but having programming experience with another language like Python or Golang is also fine.
* Security – Awareness of security best practices in infrastructure, including access control and secret management.
* Databases – Experience with querying, optimisation, monitoring, troubleshooting, migrations and fault tolerance on relational databases.
* Networking and DNS – Solid grasp of networking concepts, private networking, and DNS configurations in a cloud environment.
* Events and messaging – Experience with messaging systems like Azure Service Bus or Kafka to enable event\\-driven architectures.

Soft skills are important as well.


* + Communicates clearly and thoughtfully in both spoken and written communication, tailoring the approach to suit the audience.
	+ Takes ownership and shows initiative, following through on commitments and helping move things forward without needing to be asked.
	+ Focuses on solving real problems, using technology as a tool to create meaningful impact for the business.
	+ Shares ideas openly and respectfully, engaging in healthy debate and challenging assumptions in a constructive way.
	+ Brings a curious mindset, asking thoughtful questions and digging deeper to truly understand how things work.
	+ Comfortable with change and uncertainty, able to adjust direction as needed and help others navigate ambiguity.
	+ Breaks down complexity with clarity, turning big, messy problems into clear next steps and practical solutions.

Did you know Mews was named *Best PMS of 2025* \\- for the second year in a row \\- and twice recognized as a *Best Place to Work in Hotel Tech*?

 #### **Local benefits**



We also tailor benefits to each location \\- from regional healthcare coverage to team events, socials, and other perks that make Mews life special wherever you are.



Because at Mews, growth, balance, and belonging aren't just words, they're how we work.



 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it’s only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012\\. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest\\-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022\\. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That’s what we do, but what about who we are? Mews’ culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You’ll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after\\-work drinks, be they virtual or in\\-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you’ll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we’re ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all\\-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We’re guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it’s time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



We’re an equal opportunities employer. To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams that represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. We embrace different perspectives, encourage trying new things and want everyone to feel safe bringing their authentic self to work. If this sounds like you and you’re ready to join a global, innovative and exciting community, we’d love to hear from you.



One very important note: don’t hold back. Even if you don’t meet 100% of the criteria listed in this job description, we still encourage you to apply. We believe everyone should have equal access to opportunities and we’re committed to providing an inclusive experience, so please let us know if there’s anything we can do to support you during the application process. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability, or any other protected characteristic. We can’t wait to hear from you.


#### **AI and Hiring at Mews**



At Mews, we believe AI enhances our work but should not replace what humanises it and makes it individually ours. We see AI as a tool to support research, generate ideas, and drive efficiency, but creativity, critical thinking, and opinions differentiate us. As you apply, feel free to use AI to help structure your thoughts — but ensure your application and conversations with us, reflect your personal opinions, capabilities and experience. We’re building an AI\\-enabled workforce, and that starts with people who think independently and bring fresh ideas to the table. Because at Mews, making work more human is the ultimate goal.",True,"","","","","","","https://de.indeed.com/cmp/Mews-6","",""

NVision is a quantum biotech startup based in Ulm, Germany, with Tier 1 investors from the USA and Europe. We are just leaving stealth mode, moving from local R\\&D to global commercialization and expansion.  

  

We are developing a technology that will enable MRI\\-based imaging of real\\-time metabolism in the body, with tremendous potential for research and applications in oncology, cardiology, neurology and more. Our company brings together expertise in physics, chemistry, engineering and medicine, and we are collaborating with scientists and clinicians from top medical and research centers such as Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York, MD Anderson in Texas, Technical University of Munich, Cambridge University in the UK and more.  

  

NVision is developing fast, robust and easy\\-to\\-use hyperpolarization technology for preclinical and clinical research in our POLARIS product line. Those devices are placed close to an MRI scanner in a research or clinical environment to produce hyperpolarized contrast agents on demand in a fast, fully\\-automated, multi\\-step chemical process. Key steps of the process contain fluidic transport across multiple vessels and chemical mixing and separation processes in fully\\-reuseable or single\\-use disposable fluid paths. We develop our commercial products jointly with external design and manufacturing partners and the process development as well as the design and manufacturing of prototypes is done entirely in\\-house.


We offer a dynamic international working environment, with immense room for growth, that encourages personal initiative and open communication.

Hello future (Software) Product Engineer.


Everyone at HUBBLR is obsessed about building innovative products with our clients and we hope you are as well. We take pride in believing that the way product should be build in 2026 is a fast moving, iterative approach but other than most agencies we combine (and search) for talent that understand where we've cut corners (and why) and what it takes to scale a software product in the long run \\- so that the decision making process in the early phases can benefit from experience on what the later phases of a software project look like.


Hence we're looking for people that are happy to work in entrepreneurial, flexible but fast growing and ever changing environments and can fit to a hybrid culture while being able to take ownership in client facing projects.  

  

For this role we’re looking for a seasoned individual that has proven themselves in multiple projects to build fast (with technically creatively to hold short delivery cycles) software that eventually can scale with the time.


The tech world is changing fast and HUBBLR embraces that change. Culturally we’re looking for people who can and want to ride this wave, leveraging cutting edge technology (we provide typically sandboxed work environments to maintain our security standards and are always happy to try out new tools).
  

  

We expect our people to have a mindset that sometimes we need to unlearn existing knowledge/skills to become better in these new environments.


Most of our clients are situated in Germany, hence a high level of business English is required.

#### **The role in a nutshell**


We are looking for a persona with a background experience heavily in backend orientated roles but eventually grew into managing frontends as well and still likes hands on engineering work and loves the product work grind. Any engineer at HUBBLR should be able to take perspective on what a product manager does, meaning also owning the product, iterating on feedback of the users and bringing in ideas on how to shape products.


Furthermore we're looking for someone who is willing to take ownership and drive success in our client projects, participates in architectural \\& technical decision making and is able to build a digital product from early stages to scaling it up.


This role is a hybrid role, meaning we expect you to work at least 2\\-3 days / week from the office. We have offices in Germany (Hamburg, Münster, Mannheim) and Spain and enable you to travel, but would like you to spend time in your dedicated office to form a local team culture. This position is looking to be filled in Hamburg, Germany \\- on site days are mandatory.  

  



#### **Your Responsibilities**

* You will be supporting us in new and long\\-term projects as a (senior) software engineer
* You will be joining a growing team of 9, located in Münster, Hamburg, Mannheim and Valencia
* Together with our team you will be working mainly on client\\-projects and sharing your experience with team members
* You will be taking end to end ownership in a delivery cycle with highly autonomous decision making
* You will be actively participating in architectural and technological decisions for software projects
* You will take over own responsibilities in projects, estimate developing tasks on your own and giving other coworkers advice on their work
* You'll be reviewing code from other coworkers and actively be part of continuous improvement
* When working on client\\-projects you will be partly responsible of communicating with their CTO / Stakeholder, joining conference calls/meetings on status update, time estimation and project management

#### **Your Qualifications**

* **Experience in modern backend technologies \\- i.e. Golang, Node.js. (esp. nestjs) (must\\-have)**
* E**xperience in other backend technologies \\- PHP (esp. Laravel), Python (preferred)**
* **Experience in modern web technologies \\- Vue.js, React.js, Flutter or similar framework (must\\-have)**
* **Familiarity with agile software developing methods (must\\-have)**
* **Familiarity in responsible coding with LLM based assistants \\- i.e. Claude Code, Gemini Code, etc. (must\\-have)**
* **Experience in common API techniques \\- HTTP, GraphQL, GRPC \\- at least 1 of them (must\\-have)**
* **Communication skills for constructive team feedback and client calls (must\\-have)**
* **Analytical thinking \\& MVP mindset (must\\-have)**
* **Fluent in English (must\\-have)**
* **Minimum 4 years of experience (must\\-have)**
* **Ability to work independently on tasks (must\\-have)**
* **Work permit for Spain and living in Valencia or Valencia Region (must\\-have)**
* *Experience in E2E tests (nice\\-to\\-have)*
* *Experience in TypeScript (nice\\-to\\-have)*
* *Experience in TailwindCSS (nice\\-to\\-have)*
* *Experience in CI/CD processes (nice\\-to\\-have)*

**About the job**
-----------------


Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) combines software and systems engineering to build and run large\\-scale, massively distributed, fault\\-tolerant systems. SRE ensures that Google Cloud's services—both our internally critical and our externally\\-visible systems—have reliability, uptime appropriate to customer's needs and a fast rate of improvement. Additionally SRE’s will keep an ever\\-watchful eye on our systems capacity and performance.  



  

Much of our software development focuses on optimizing existing systems, building infrastructure and eliminating work through automation. On the SRE team, you’ll have the opportunity to manage the complex challenges of scale which are unique to Google Cloud, while using your expertise in coding, algorithms, complexity analysis and large\\-scale system design. SRE's culture of intellectual curiosity, problem solving and openness is key to its success. Our organization brings together people with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We encourage them to collaborate, think big and take risks in a blame\\-free environment. We promote self\\-direction to work on meaningful projects, while we also strive to create an environment that provides the support and mentorship needed to learn and grow.

Behind everything our users see online is the architecture built by the Technical Infrastructure team to keep it running. From developing and maintaining our data centers to building the next generation of Google platforms, we make Google's product portfolio possible. We're proud to be our engineers' engineers and love voiding warranties by taking things apart so we can rebuild them. We keep our networks up and running, ensuring our users have the best and fastest experience possible.

**Responsibilities**
--------------------

* Engage in and improve the whole lifecycle of services—from inception and design, through to deployment, operation and refinement.
* Support services before they go live through activities such as system design consulting, developing software platforms and frameworks, capacity planning and launch reviews.
* Maintain services once they are live by measuring and monitoring availability, latency and overall system health.
* Scale systems sustainably through mechanisms like automation, and evolve systems by pushing for changes that improve reliability and velocity.
* Practice sustainable incident response and blameless postmortems.
Google is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is an affirmative action employer.

----------------



At Serco, we don’t just support space exploration—we help make it possible. For decades, we’ve been a trusted partner at ESA’s European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, playing a vital role in some of the most ambitious space missions humanity has ever undertaken. From spacecraft operations to ground systems and data processing, our expertise has earned us recognition, including ESA’s prestigious Best in Domain awards.


Every day, we work hand\\-in\\-hand with ESA to ensure mission success and push the boundaries of innovation.


Now, we’re looking for someone who wants to be part of this story. We currently have an exciting opportunity for a NOC Technician based at our customer site, ESOC.

**Your Mission**
----------------



Imagine stepping into the heart of a mission operations environment where every action you take keeps spacecraft connected, data flowing, and critical systems online. In this role, you become the coordinating force that ensures our operational ecosystem runs smoothly—day, night, and across continents.


Your mission begins at the intersection of engineering, operations, and real‑time decision‑making. Each day, you will collaborate closely with spacecraft operators, mission control teams, external partners, and ground stations around the world. You orchestrate the movements, aligning resources, schedules, and technical configurations so that missions receive the support they need—exactly when they need it.


You are the person who keeps our operational rhythm steady.


When a ground station must be configured in real time—whether during standard hours or in the quiet of the night—you are the one who ensures everything is ready, online, and performing at its best. You monitor station health, data flows, and system behaviours, catching anomalies before they escalate and taking swift action when something doesn’t look right.


And when the unexpected happens, you are the first line of defence.


You triage incidents, support users of critical systems, troubleshoot issues across applications, networks, and hardware, and escalate when required—all while maintaining clear communication with those who depend on you. Whether analysing a network fault, performing maintenance on CISCO components, or identifying root causes across TCP/IP‑based systems, you bring calm, clarity, and competence to high‑stakes situations.


Behind the scenes, your documentation becomes the backbone of operational knowledge. Logs, incident records, resolutions, and anomaly reports are all captured through your diligence. You contribute to user briefings, workshops, and operational reviews, helping ensure the whole organisation stays aligned and informed.


Your mission doesn’t stop there.


You operate within a structured shift system that ensures 24/7 service continuity, handing over seamlessly to colleagues and maintaining consistent service levels. You also play an active role in continuously improving processes, proposing enhancements, and identifying opportunities to refine how we deliver operational excellence.


From administrative upkeep to real‑time orchestration, from first‑response troubleshooting to enabling mission success—you are at the centre of it all.


This is your mission:  

to safeguard operational performance, elevate service reliability, and keep our missions connected to the world—every hour, every day.

**What You'll Bring**
---------------------



You’re someone who steps into a mission‑critical environment with a sense of calm confidence—because you know exactly what you’re doing and why it matters. You bring with you not just technical skills, but a mindset shaped by curiosity, accountability, and a drive to keep complex systems running flawlessly.


You understand the language of networks—WAN, LAN, routing, switching, connectivity—not as abstract terms, but as the living infrastructure that keeps operations alive. Troubleshooting to you isn’t a task; it’s a puzzle you’re eager to solve. You navigate system monitoring tools, logs, and dashboards with the natural instinct of someone who has spent time in real operational environments. When something looks off, you spot it early. When something breaks, you move fast.


You arrive with PC literacy and MS Office already in your toolkit, but your real strength lies in the way you apply logic to every situation. Fault diagnosis follows a path in your mind: identify, isolate, test, resolve. Whether the issue is a misconfigured network component or an unexpected system alert, your approach is structured, analytical, and reliable.


You understand the importance of IT security, even at a foundational level. You know that every action, every system, and every user connection plays a part in maintaining operational integrity.


But your technical skills are only part of the story.


You bring decisiveness, because you know that hesitation can cost time in environments where seconds matter. You carry accountability, taking ownership of tasks from start to finish. You communicate clearly in fluent English, ensuring users feel supported and informed. You bring a strong service ethic—courteous, responsive, and patient—even when the pressure rises.


You collaborate naturally, moving seamlessly between conversations with engineers, managers, and fellow operators. You’re a team player who respects the flow of information and the value of shared expertise. And you’re ready for the rhythm of 24/7 shift work, understanding that mission support doesn’t sleep—and neither does your commitment.

**Nice to Have — What Makes You Even More Exceptional**


Perhaps you’ve been part of remote operations of satellite ground stations, or supported the day‑to‑day running of a manned station. Maybe you already understand the inner workings of ESTRACK, or have experience navigating ITSM tools or the ITIL framework.


You might have touched environments involving VMS, Unix, Console Works, NetBackup, CD‑ROM production, CiscoWorks, HP‑OV, CISCO Firewalls, QIP, or MS Windows systems. If so, you already speak part of the language used here every day.


If you’ve mastered linear fault‑finding or enjoy coaching others, then you’re not just solving the problems of today—you’re helping the whole team prepare for tomorrow.

**What We Offer: More Than Just a Job**
---------------------------------------



Joining Serco at ESOC isn’t just about the work—it’s about the experience. We know that moving for a role like this is a big step, so we make sure you’re supported every step of the way:

"Founding AI Engineer","Alago","München, BY, DE","","indeed","2025-09-26","https://de.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=342127b542179469","https://join.com/companies/alagoai/14929839-founding-ai-engineer?pid=a13795120131dbe48464","The construction industry loses $1\\.6 trillion annually to inefficiencies. A huge part? Repeating the same mistakes over and over because critical information is still stuck in paperwork and scattered systems.
  
  

alago fixes this by putting existing data to work, instead of letting documentation gather dust. We help teams eliminate double data entry and manual busywork by connecting to existing tools, processing project data, and automating workflows between people and AI. With every project, alago gets more powerful —spotting risks and turning past challenges into future wins.
  
  

We’ve just raised a seven\\-figure pre\\-seed led by top construction tech VCs and one of Germany’s largest project developers. 75% of the infrastructure that will exist in 2050 does not exist today. Let’s build it better!
  
  

Aufgaben
  
  

As one of our first hires, you'll have unprecedented technical autonomy to architect novel AI systems from the ground up, working directly with founders who understand that breakthrough AI requires both deep technical expertise and creative freedom.
  
  

You'll be solving genuinely hard AI problems that don't have established solutions—the kind that require reading papers, prototyping novel approaches, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in production systems.
  
  

* Design novel AI architectures: Build production agentic systems that go far beyond simple LLM wrappers—create sophisticated multi\\-agent workflows with custom reasoning, memory, and tool\\-use patterns.
* Push the limits of multimodal AI: Work with some of the most challenging unstructured data you've encountered (construction documents, images…) and develop novel approaches to extract structured insights at scale.
* Own the full research\\-to\\-production pipeline: From experimenting with cutting\\-edge techniques to building robust evaluation frameworks to optimizing inference at scale—you control the entire technical journey.
* Build AI\\-first infrastructure: Design and implement novel data pipelines, vector architectures, and evaluation systems that enable rapid experimentation while maintaining production reliability.


**What makes this role unique:**  

* $500\\+/month AI budget for experimentation with latest models and techniques
* Direct customer feedback loop to validate AI performance in real\\-world scenarios
* No legacy constraints—green field opportunity to implement state\\-of\\-the\\-art approaches
* Research freedom to explore and implement novel techniques from recent papers


You'll be working closely with Vinzenz (CTO) and Ann (CPO) \\- both technical founders who understand that great AI requires both deep technical investment and product intuition.
  
  

**Our Stack:**  

**Tech at a glance:** TypeScript, Next.js, Vercel, Supabase (PostgreSQL \\+ pgvector), LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, LangFuse, TanStack Query
  
  

Qualifikation
  
  

This is the perfect role for an AI engineer who wants to join an early\\-stage company and push the boundaries of what's possible with AI in construction.
  
  

**Must\\-Haves:**  

* C1 fluency in German – You'll work with complex construction industry data and need to understand domain nuances to build effective AI systems that actually solve real problems.
* 2\\+ years building production AI systems – You've shipped AI features that real users depend on, not just experimented with APIs. You understand the gap between ""demo magic"" and production reliability.
* TypeScript proficiency – When your AI system needs a frontend interface or API integration, you can build it without waiting for other team members.
* Shipping velocity – You prototype fast, measure everything, and iterate based on real user feedback. When you say ""I'll build an AI feature to solve this,"" it ships within days, not months.


**Bonus Points:**  

* Previous startup experience – especially if you were the ""AI person"" who had to figure everything out
* Domain expertise in construction, manufacturing, or other complex industries with messy data
* Open source contributions or impressive side projects in AI/ML
* You've built AI systems that replaced hours of manual work – show us the impact


Benefits
  
  

As one of our first hires, you’ll do more than contribute — you’ll help shape how Alago works: our culture, systems, and growth strategy. You’ll work directly with the founders, gain exposure to every function, and ship projects that have immediate impact.
  
  

* 10× Learning Curve. Work with cutting\\-edge AI to tackle real\\-world challenges every day
* You ship fast and own the outcome. You’ll design solutions that take the pain out of project management, automating away the repetitive tasks and overhead teams hate.
* Work directly with the founders. You’ll own critical parts of alago end\\-to\\-end, laying the technical foundation while balancing rapid iteration, customer value, and long\\-term scalability.
* A vibrant in\\-office culture in our central Munich office. We come together in our Munich office at least three days a week. Beyond that, you’re welcome to work remotely for a few weeks at a time whenever your circumstances or preferences require it.
* Competitive salary \\& meaningful equity stake, so you are invested in our success
* Your needs and well\\-being matter to us. You’ll get access to sponsored EGYM Wellpass to find inner peace at yoga or kill it at HIIT workouts.


We’re building for scale — but right now, it’s still early. That means lots of autonomy, tight feedback loops, and the freedom to grow into whatever role suits your strengths, whether that’s become top individual contributor or stepping into leadership roles like VP Engineering.
  
  

About the application process
  
  

1\\\\. Submit your story
  
  

* Tell us about something you built that had real impact.


2\\\\. Intro Call (30min)
  
  

* Intro, Logistics \\& Fit with a founder.


3\\\\. Product \\& Tech Deep Dive (30min)
  
  

* Get to know Product and Tech with a founder.
