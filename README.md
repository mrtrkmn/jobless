# Jobless - Automated IT Job Search in Germany

This repository contains an automated job search script that scrapes IT and Software Engineering positions in Germany using JobSpy.

## Features

- 🔍 Searches for IT/Software Engineering jobs in Germany (prioritizing Berlin)
- 📅 Runs automatically every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC
- 📊 Generates CSV files with job listings
- 📦 Uploads results as GitHub Actions artifacts
- 💾 Commits results to the `jobs/` directory

## File Structure
- `jobs/` directory: Historical CSV results are stored here by the CI workflow and can be tracked in the repository.
- `germany_it_jobs_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`: Example output CSV filename generated by the script (timestamped).

## Job Search Coverage

The script searches for the following positions:
- Software Engineer
- Software Developer
- DevOps Engineer
- Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)
- System Engineer
- Backend Developer
- Full Stack Developer
- Python Developer
- Java Developer

### Job Boards Scraped
- Indeed
- LinkedIn
- Google Jobs

## Automated Workflow

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automates running the job search and preserving results. Typical workflow steps:

- **Trigger**: Scheduled (`cron`) weekly (Every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC) and manual (`workflow_dispatch`) for on-demand runs.
- **Checkout**: Pulls the repository so results can be committed back to `jobs/`.
- **Setup Python**: Uses a supported Python version (3.11+) for reproducible runs.
- **Install dependencies**: Installs from `requirements.txt`.
- **Run search**: Executes `python searh_germany_jobs.py` which produces a timestamped CSV (e.g. `germany_it_jobs_20260204_093000.csv`).
- **Upload artifact**: The generated CSV is uploaded as a workflow artifact (default retention 90 days).
- **Persist results**: The workflow optionally copies or moves the CSV into the `jobs/` directory and commits it to the repository (so historical results are tracked).

Notes:

- The script writes a timestamped CSV to the runner workspace. The workflow determines whether that file is committed into `jobs/` or only stored as an artifact.
- If you change the script output filename or columns, update the workflow step that collects or commits files accordingly.

## Manual Usage

To run the script manually:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the script
python searh_germany_jobs.py
```

The script will generate a CSV file in the `jobs/` directory with a timestamp in the filename (e.g., `jobs/germany_it_jobs_20260204_093000.csv`).

## CSV Output Format

The generated CSV files contain the following information:
- Job title
- Company name
- Location
- Job type
- Job board source
- Date posted
- Job URL
- Description
- Remote status
- Salary information (if available)
- Company details
- And more...

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- python-jobspy
- pandas
